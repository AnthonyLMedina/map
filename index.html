The NYPD continues to battle an increase in shooting incidents across New York City for a year shrouded by the coronavirus pandemic. The drastic increase in gun violence began during the summer months, from July to August, when a consistent rise in shooting incidents were recorded.  </p>
	<p>
Residents in the confines of the NYPD 75th Precinct, which covers East New York and Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, are no strangers to the increased gun violence that spread across the city. Over the summer, the NYPD experienced a +130% increase in citywide shooting incidents in June, +177% increase in July, and a +166% increase in August.  </p>
